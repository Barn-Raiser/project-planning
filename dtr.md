# DTR: Define the Relationship
Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
   * GraphQL as stretch tech 
   * Accessibility focus - tab-ability, ui/ux design, etc.  
   * Hand made authentication - focus on accessibility to whole community
   * Maybe OAuth - option to login via third party 
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* How would you describe your work style?
   * Communication is key - communicate regularly, update the team 
   * Daily meeting - 1h ish
   * Divide and conquer!
   * "In-office" style - working independently, but around for chats/support
   * Leverage mentors for support/input
   * Actively ping people for PR reviews
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
   * Andrew - big picture 
   * Dean - CSS & Design 
   * Shauna - FE Logic
   * Aliya - Optimism! Organization
* What's gone well or poorly in your previous projects?  
   * Be cautious about MVP scope 
   * Try to leverage agile methodologies 
      * 1-week sprints 
   * Keep it simple - think about dependencies and order of execution 
   * Balance! Self-care, rest when you need it. 
   * Try to avoid unproductive struggle - ask lots of questions! 
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
   * Sleep, self care > project. Respect and support each other in our code-time-boundaries. 
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  * Ensure we take time daily + weekly to rest
  * Monday - Saturday are our work days
  * Shauna - in Scotland! MT +7h | 8am-7pm MT
  * Dean - Pacific! MT -1h | 8am-8pm MT // currently interviewing 
  * Aliya - Mountain | 8am-8pm MT // currently interviewing 
  * Andrew - Mountain | spontaneous! - unavailable Mondays at 6:30pm MT (possibly)
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  * Dean - prefers to receive direct, immediate feedback
  * Shauna - prefers immediate feedback, honesty
  * Aliya - kind, actionable feedback, timely
  * Andrew - doesn't take things personally, and can sometimes come off as critical in feedback though that's not the intent 
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  * Github Projects as an organization (both repos under one board) 
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  * Good quality project, doesn't need to be flashy 
  * Good enough to present at code fair, but probably won't go on to demo comp
  * Does *not* consume our lives over the next 2.5 weeks 
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  * Andrew will handle this
