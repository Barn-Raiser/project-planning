# Project Planning

## Resources
* [Wireframes](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/Qk9iTWJpWWVwRVRnN1g1cTFwSktLbTh5RXl4RnhCdlh6NjhkdVdnSmlaM3ZpbmtYMUV1aFJlU1JhbXNCSWJNT3wzMDc0NDU3MzU3NzAyMTI5NTQw)
* [Schema](https://dbdiagram.io/d/6126a4586dc2bb6073bb843d)

## Design Inspirations
* [Dribble Collection](https://dribbble.com/ShaunaMyers/collections/5096826-Barnraiser)
* [Background Image](https://www.stocksy.com/963907/two-hands-reaching-towards-each-other-on-a-bright-spring-day-filled-with-flowers)
* [Website 1- baby registry](https://www.babylist.com/)
  - Like the simplicity of the buttons on the home page. These could be options to ask or offer assistance.
* [Website 2- target gift registry](https://www.target.com/gift-registry/create-baby-registry)
  - When you click "Find a registry" input boxes appear. This would be great for users offering assistance on our page. We could ask them to input a zip code here,   before they move on to view a list of needs associated with that zip code.
* [Website 3- Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.co.uk/)
  - Inputs are minimal for address and email
  - Good styling, with the opacity of the background of the form, the H1 boldness and placement, and button coloring and placement.
* [Website 4- helper site](https://www.helperos.com/needhelp.php)
  - Home page is close to what we're envisioning, with the two questions and associated buttons to take user to appropriate view
  - Forms are set up nicely as well and give us a good idea about need categories and how to situate input fields

* [x] Create wireframes
