* Visible to all site visitors (no authentication needed) 

## Iteration 2 - Sprint 2
#### Search and filter "Needs" index page by some attributes
#### Assign category(/ies) to a "Need"

## Iteration 3 - Sprint 3

#### Associate users with needs as supporters
#### [TBD] Associate users with needs as points of contact
#### [TBD] Authorization - Assign roles to users (organizer, community member) with different views/permissions

## Feature brain dump - future work 
* "Organizer" role users can approve/deny "Need" submissions
* User dashboard: On visiting their dashboard, a user can see all upcoming "Needs" they are supporters on, and upcoming "Needs" they are points of contact on. They can also toggle to see past Needs they participated in. 
* Incorporate an add-to-calendar feature when a user signs up to support a "Need"
* Incorporate census data API to show stats about the population of a given zip code on search?
